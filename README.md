In your new `publish_blog` folder, you will spot a `mkdocs.yml`. This file allows you to customize your blog! The most important to edit :
1. `site_name` 
2. `site_description`
3. `site_url` (critical) : By default, it's `https://github_username.io/repo_name`[^1]

To edit the logo and the favicon, first put the chosen file in `assets/logo`, and change `logo` and `favicon` :
1. `logo: assets/logo/logo_name.png`
2. `favicon: assets/logo/favicon.png`

You can customize :
- Font
- Color scheme, palette, icons 
- Language  

Also, don't forget to delete the documentation folder, the contents in assets and clean the notes folder!

[Check the documentation to get more information](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/)

You don't need to touch anything in `features` ; `markdown_extensionsâ€¦`

## Local testing (optional)

To run locally the blog, you need to install the requirements and run `mkdocs serve`.
```
cd publish_blog
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

The blog will be published through [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) using the `gh-page` branch. Everything is already configured by the template for that.
